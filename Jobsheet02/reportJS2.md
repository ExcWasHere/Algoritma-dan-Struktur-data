### 2.1.3 Question Answers
1. In object-oriented programming, a class functions as a blueprint or plan that can only be declared once, while objects are physical entities that can be instantiated multiple times from the same class. Each object contains attributes (variables that store data) and methods (functions that perform operations) that work together.

2. Student class has 4 attribute 
<ol>- Student Id</ol>
<ol>- Student name</ol>
<ol>- Class name</ol>
<ol>- GPA</ol>

3. Student class has 4 methods
<ol>- Print</ol>
<ol>- Change class</ol>
<ol>- Update GPA</ol>
<ol>- Evaluate</ol>

5. The evaluate() method evaluates the student performance by evaluating the value of the students GPA by the parameter given. It returns a String value of either cumlaude, good, fair and poor

2. To access an object attributes we use the don notation (.) followed by variable
3. Because the first print() is executed before the changeClass() and updateGPA() ran. So the first print() output is before and the second print() is after the two methods are executed.

## 2.3.3 Questions Answer

2. The new Tugas2Zero calls the constructor of Tugas2Zero class to create a new Tugas2Zero object and it will pass the four argument user inputted to the constructor that will be assigned to each attributes
3. If we remove the default constructor, we will get an error message. Because, in Tugas2First we call a constructor that need no argument, but in Tugas2Zero Class we only provide a constructor that needs 4 argument, that's why it throws an error
4. No, because it works independently unless it needs another result from another methods and will work as long as it has been instantiated

The implementation is in **Student19.java** & **StudentMain.java**, and this is a screenshot for the result:
